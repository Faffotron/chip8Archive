About
-----
Expedition was written for [Nokia 3310 Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam3), which imposes creative constraints similar to those of the world's most famous indestructible brick-phone. This year's theme was "ON/OFF."  Graphics for _Expedition_ are 1-bit, using a palette which resembles the 3310 display at 84x48 pixels, and I use an authentic recreation of the 3310's variable-width bitmap font. Controls use a minimum of three buttons, suitable for one-handed play on a real phone. All audio is simple and monophonic. 

The game is a short narrative experience inspired by point-and-click adventure games and the "escape the room" style of flash game that was extremely popular during the era of the Nokia 3310. It is written in CHIP-8 assembly language, using the Octo development system.

Special thanks to SystemLogoff for testing a pre-release build.
